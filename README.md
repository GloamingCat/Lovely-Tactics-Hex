## Lovely Tactics Hex

The Lovely Tactics Hex project is a framework for development of tactical role-playing games (TRPG), built using the LÖVE2D engine.
The main games used as inspiration for this project are Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (for GBA), Jeanne D'arc, and Trails in the Sky (both for PSP).
The "Hex" in the name is because the battle grid is hexagonal. I plan, though, to adapt it to orthogonal and isometric grids someday.

## Motivation

I started this project as just a TRPG that I wanted to make, then I realized that the code could be generalized enough to be turned into an engine.

## Documentation and API

Since this project is still under development, its design and features may change a lot, so I'll write a proper documentation when it gets more stable.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to first install LÖVE2D. Follow steps here: https://love2d.org/.
Once the engine is properly installed, all you have to do is run the project folder as any other game made in the engine.

## Notes

* Sorry for the ugly art, I had to make it myself rushly so I could test the game properly;
* There are still a lot of features I want to code, such as mouse and touch input, sound, individual shader properties for each sprite, and some other stuff. I will also receive any suggestions anyone want to give;
* Free movement mode and scenes were not tested enough (I have other priorities);
* My current goal is to write a experimental AI model for the battle enemies. Since it's a university project, it has the higher priority, so I will do the other stuff when this one is done;
* I also made a simple editor for the gama data, in Java, but the code is just too ugly and messy for me to share. The editor also changes a lot since I frequently need to change the way the game data is represented to add new features. But if anyone REALLY wants to see it, you can send me an e-mail.
