## Lovely Tactics Hex

The Lovely Tactics Hex project is a framework for development of tactical role-playing games (TRPG), built using the LÖVE2D engine.
The main games used as inspiration for this project are Final Fantasy Tactics Advance (for GBA), Jeanne D'arc, and Trails in the Sky (both for PSP).
The "Hex" in the name is because the battle grid is hexagonal. I plan, though, to adapt it to orthogonal and isometric grids someday.

## Motivation

I started this project as just a TRPG that I wanted to make, then I realized that the code could be generalized enough to be turned into an engine.

## Documentation and API

Since this project is still under development, its design and features may change a lot, so I'll write a proper documentation when it gets more stable.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to first install LÖVE2D. Follow steps here: https://love2d.org/.
Once the engine is properly installed, all you have to do is run the project folder as any other game made in the engine.
