This folder contains scripts to quickly export the game.

pack_love.bat
	- Zips the game's files and creates the "game.love" file in the root folder.
pack_web.bat [needs love.js installed]
	- Uses the "game.love" file and generates the "web" folder with a web page to play the game on a browser.
	- Also zips the necessary files and creates a "game.zip" file in the web folder to be uploaded to sites like itch.io.
pack_windows.bat
	- Zips the "game.love" file with the necessary files in the "lib" folder to create a shareable zip for Windows users.

Run pack_love.bat when you're done with the game.
Run pack_web.bat if the platform in the config files is set to "Web Browser" or run pack_window.bat if the platform is set to "Desktop".
